# Redux Feedback Loop


## Description

Duration: 12 hours

Objective

In this assignment i was instructed to create a reflection/feedback form modeled after Prime's system. The feedback form has to be over 4  a separate review pages. It will display the current feedback values and a submit button. When all steps are complete, your app will save the feedback in the database that has already been setup. 

## Usage

- This app starts with the how are you feeling page, the user puts in a number of 1-5 and then can click on the next page.
- The next will will ask the user about their understanding and the user will be prompted to enter a number to rate their understanding and click next.
- The user will the be taken to the support page and comments page will be prompted to do the same.
- Finally, users will be taken to the review page to see their answer and will be prompted to submit.
- On submission user will get to the thank you page and will have the option in leaving a new feedback, which will then prompt them to the feeling page again.

## Problems

one of the main problems I ran into was how I organized the structure of the assigment. Now that I am looking back I would have save so much time if is started with the index and components folder and came back to the App.js last. I also had trouble with some of the installations and my server was not working properly.
